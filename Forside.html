                <h3> I am Xenia Goethe</h3>
                <p> I am a digital media student based in Næstved, near the beautiful Skovtårnet in Rønnede.
                    I've always known I wanted to work in a creative field, just not exactly how or where.
                    My interest for digital media sparked when my brother, who's also a programmer,
                    and I started having these amazing brainstorms and long
                    discussions about business ideas and game development, and just the thought of being able
                    to achieve some of those things, fills my body with excitement and an insant urge to start working
                    on them.

                <h3>A digital media student</h3>
                <p>
                    I live with my boyfriend and my cat Coco. Coco is quite the petfluencer and you can check out his
                    instagram in the bottom.
                    I am curious by heart, and that have resulted in me, trying quite a few different mediums, but I
                    keep
                    coming back to making
                    clay creations and drawing, wether digital or in hand, which is why I've chosen to showcase these. I
                    am
                    fueled by my passion to
                    learn and be the best I can be, in my field, which is why I consider myself a forever student.

            <p class="arnestekst"> This was the first assignment we got, where we had to recreate Arnes portfolio, who's
                a character
                from a danish tv-show.

                It is the first time, I've tried to work with HTML and CSS, which also means that it's filled with flaws
                and is non-responsive, but the process
                taught me a lot about the basics. If I was to do this project again, I would ímprove the syntax
                and make sure it is responsive, to make sure it looks as I intended, no matter what device you're using.

            <h3>Choose your next trip!</h3>
            <p class="verdenstekst">
                When making this website, I was much more confident in the basics of HTML and CSS.
                That also meant that I was able to play around a lot more, with different styling and
                effects. In the burger menu, you can see, that I made a gallery and a spinning wheel.
                The gallery does not display the large images as I wanted, as they become very pixelated
                when enhanced. The way I would solve this problem today, would be either to make a different
                kind of gallery, that better supports the images that I've chosen or choose images with a higher
                resolution.
                <br>
                The spinning wheel is made with javascript, which is very new territory to me. There is definetely room
                for improvement,
                the next time, I am making anything similar. I would for one, make sure to either make an arrow to
                indicate
                what field the wheel lands on, or make an animation of some kind, to show the chosen field. I would also
                style it differently,
                so that the text isn't off-center and doesn't get cut off.

            <h3>Bouquet</h3>
            <p>My grandma and grandpa celebrated 50 years of marriage last year.
                My grandparents means the world to me. We've always been very close, which I am very
                greatful for. I was thinking about getting them flowers, but I wanted to give them something
                that would last for years, and that's when I got the idea. I should make the flowers myself!
                So of course they needed 50 roses to represent each year of their marriage.
                The look on their faces, when they opened the gift, made it all worth it. Now they proudly show it off
                when they have guests over.

                Making the roses is quite a lengthy process, as every pedal is made in hand, one by one, and then
                assembled as roses.
                This particular bouquet took about 1 month, from start to finish, working on it in my spare time.

            <h3>Book nook</h3>
            <p>
                To continue the 50 years theme, my mom is turning 50 this year and I wanted to do something big for her
                as she's always been there for me. So I made her a punch board with 50 gifts to open, every day until
                her birthday
                and this book nook is one of those gifts. The function of a book nook, is to stand between books on the
                shelf as decor.

                My idea for the book nook was a fairy-forest vibe. To achieve that, I made the signs and the door with
                polymer clay, giving it a rustic look
                and like the fairies build it themselves.

            <h3>The mad monster</h3>
            <p>I am in the process of working on a childrens book, about this misunderstood little fellow
                who scares everyone away, because everyone always thinks he's mad. In reality he is just really lonely
                and
                just as scared of them, as they are of him. One day he meets a new friend, who shows him a world, that
                suddenly doesn't seem so scary anymore. It's almost like his own world is starting to change. 
                Sometimes we react in anger and lash out, when we are really scared, and doesn't know how to handle it. This book is being made
                with the goal of understanding our own and others emotions a little better and learning how to communicate those big feelings,
                to the people closest to us. 
<br>
                It is still on the drawing board, but I have a great vision for this, and I can't wait to update you on the project!

            <h3>Repeat-pattern</h3>
            <p>
                I made some different repeat patterns, but this one is my favorite. My reasoning for making this pattern 
                in the first place, is that I wanted to wrap my boyfriends presents in something he would get really excited to open 
                and since he loves gaming, I knew I wanted to make some related to that.
                My thought process then became, that Playstation by far is his prefered console, so I needed to include that, but
                <span class="highlight-container1"><span class="highlight">I also wanted it to include the classics, for that nostalgia feeling. </span></span>
                 To add a little touch of me, I included The Sims logo, as that is the game I play the most.
